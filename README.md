# Beta version
Full functionality as a web application<br>
To do list that uses local storage to store color values and the array containing event objects. Uses alerts to set reminders for each event.<br>
<strong>Future changes</strong><br>
1. use a service worker to implement background script so that reminders can be set off even when the application is closed<br>
2. switch local storage with chrome.storage.local API so that the background script can also access the array containing events
